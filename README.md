# CSVtoGraph
This program reads and parses a CSV file, with information distances between cities, into a weighted adjacency matrix. It then 
uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths between the cities. It allows the user to choose a city as the starting point 
via the console, and then prints out a list of distances and paths from that city to all other cities in the matrix.

NOTE: The cities.csv file is located in the bin folder, and the program reads it from there.
