# CSVtoGraph
This program reads and parses a CSV file, with information distances between cities, into a weighted adjacency matrix. It then uses Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest paths between the cities. It allows the user to choose a city as the starting point via the console, and then prints out a list of distances and paths from that city to all other cities in the matrix.
